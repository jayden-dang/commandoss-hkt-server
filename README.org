  ✅ What's Working (Database Integration):

  - behavior_inputs table: ✅ 2 records from your tests
  - users table: ✅ 3 sample users from migration
  - scoring_results table: ❌ 0 records
  - zk_proofs table: ❌ 0 records

  🔧 Why Only behavior_inputs Has Data:

  Looking at our unified_endpoints.rs, the flow is:

  1. ✅ WORKING: Behavior input storage → Real database insert
  2. 🚧 TODO: AI scoring → Currently mock/memory only
  3. 🚧 TODO: ZK proof generation → Currently mock/memory only
  4. 🚧 TODO: Store scoring results → Not implemented yet
  5. 🚧 TODO: Store ZK proofs → Not implemented yet

  This is Perfect for Current Stage! 🎯

  Your test shows our progressive integration is working correctly:

  # What test_zkpersona.sh does:
  1. ✅ Sends behavior data → Stored in database
  2. ✅ Gets mock AI score → Works but not persisted
  3. ✅ Gets mock ZK proof → Works but not persisted
  4. ✅ Verifies proof → Works with validation

  Next Integration Steps (In Order):

  1. 📊 Scoring Results Storage - Add real database insert for AI scores
  2. 🔐 ZK Proof Storage - Add real database insert for generated proofs
  3. 🤖 Real AI Service - Replace mock scoring with actual ML model
  4. 🔒 Real ZK Service - Replace mock proofs with actual ZK generation

  Your platform is working perfectly! The test creates behavior records as expected, and the API
  responds correctly. The missing records in other tables are intentional since we're doing incremental
  database integration.
